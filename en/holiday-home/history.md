Het Fluisterbos, a holiday home with history..
 
The first residents of the building were the Van den Broecke brothers. These hard-working coal merchants were selling their coal here in this spot from 1920 onwards.
 
Their business flourished until they too were confronted with the new reality. The coal mines closed as other sources of heating, such as heating oil and natural gas, were on the rise.
 
In those transitional years, this architecturally beautiful building fell into disrepair.
This has become the ideal location for our new dream : a holiday home in the heart of Oostende where we can welcome groups up to 14 people.
 
There were 6 years of hard and passionate work between dream and deed. The stylish fa√ßade has been professionally renovated and the rear has been demolished and rebuilt into a modern, comfortable and cosy holiday home.
 
We look forward to sharing our dream with you!
