We named our premises Het Fluisterbos (Whisper forest) after the work of art “ Whisper trees” made by [Yves Velter] who is a contemporary artist living in Oostende.
 
You can admire the work “ Whisper trees” opposite our holiday home.
In the trees on the square there is a sculpture representing a cluster of ears. They symbolize the trees that are silent witnesses of the neighbourhood. Friends and neighbours often meet each other there to share their experiences and stories. And the trees are eavesdroppers whether they like it or not…
 
With time these ears will become part of the trees and will be absorbed by them in the end.
Nature blends into the surroundings just like the various cultures represented in our neighbourhood.
 
In his choice of materials and method, the artist was assisted by arborist Paul C. Luttik.
