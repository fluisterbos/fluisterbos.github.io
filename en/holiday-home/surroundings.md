[Ostend][oostende.en] has something for everyone.
 
Sports’ adepts can walk and cycle for miles along the coast.
For culture vultures we highly recommend [MuZee][muzee.en], [de Grote Post][grotepost.en] and the [Casino][casino.en] which are within walking distance.
There is also a renowned theatre festival called [Theater aan Zee][taz.en] worth attending during the summer.

The beach is at about 500 metres and most of the shopping streets have been pedestrianized. So, Oostende stands for a lot of beach fun and shopping pleasure.

There is a range of restaurants that welcome you for a quick bite, gourmet meals and genuine bistro cuisine.
Finally, Oostende is the ideal starting point for visiting other [seaside resorts][kust.en], cities such as [Bruges][brugge.en] and [Ghent][gent.en] or [Flanders Fields][flfields.en] if you’re interested in war commemoration.
